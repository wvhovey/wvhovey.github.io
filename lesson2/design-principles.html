                    <h3 class="subheading">Repetition</h3>
                    <h4 class="site-name">Riot Games: Valorant</h4>
                    <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/">valorant.com</a>

                    <p class="explanation">Riot Games does an excellent job using repetition in their website for one of their games called Valorant. We can see there is repetition in their color scheme with the same pink color being used in many ways from buttons to subheadings to graphic elements. The darker blackish color is used in the main header as well as different shades and tints being used for subheadings and other text on the page. </p>

                <section id="section2">
                    <h3 class="subheading">Alignment</h3>
                    <h4 class="site-name">Santouka Hokkaido Ramen</h4>
                    <a href="https://santouka-usa.com/menu">santouka-usa.com</a>
                    <div>
                        <img src="images/img-alignment.png" alt="screenshot of ramen menu">
                    </div>
                    
                    <p class="explanation">Santouka Hokkaido Ramen does fantastic work with their site, making sure every element is consistently aligned. In the menu view shown here, we can see how the images, heading, and description of each menu item are all aligned consistently to the left. In addition, each of the images are also aligned on their right side which makes this view very pleasing to the eye.</p>

                    <h3 class="subheading">Proximity</h3>
                    <h4 class="site-name">Rotten Tomatoes</h4>
                    <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/" target="blank">rottentomatoes.com</a>
                    <div>
                        <img src="images/img-proximity.png" alt="screenshot of rottentomatoes website">
                    </div>
                    
                    <p class="explanation">Rotten Tomatoes is a great example of proximity, keeping all related elements near each other and all unrelated elements farther away. There is proximity between the category headings and the pictures of various movie posters. This is how we know which movies belong to which category. In addition, the rating of each movie and its name are directly under the poster. This close proximity allows us to immediately recognize the relationship between the ratings and their respective movies.</p>
