                    <h3>A Taste of Boston's History</h3>
                    <p>Walk down any street in Boston where you are treading on the footsteps of history and the foundation of 
                        commerce in the Colonies. The Colonists proclivity and devotion to their food, 
                        and related, businesses that they established and grew, led to the “revolutionary” 
                        idea of independence and the founding of the United States. It was the high tariffs on sugar, 
                        molasses, tea, etc. cutting into their business profits that caused the uproar that set the course 
                        towards pecuniary freedom. Public Houses and Taverns were the meeting places of businessmen who were 
                        campaigning for change and recruiting colonists to unite in an organized manner. Food was big business 
                        in the colonies encompassing farming, bakeries, public houses, exporters, etc. So, with Boston being a 
                        “hub” of the best restaurants since the 1600’s and comprising a wide variety of ethnic restaurants; it’s 
                        fitting that the newest innovation in food services would appear. The Food Truck is rolling into Boston’s 
                        culinary scene, which is bringing another enhancement to Boston’s commerce.

            <p class="purpose-p">
                This chamber began because the owners attempted to follow their dreams to start a food truck while they were in a their early 20's.
                They had no support and they failed many times until, by pure chance, they succeeded. It is the goal of this chamber to prevent that from happening to anyone who is attempting 
                to run a food truck in the greater Boston area. We offer financial assistance from the high taxes of Massachusetts, legal advice on how to begin
                the process of food trucking, regular luncheons, free advertisement on social media platforms with access to our advertisement department, and so much more.
                Every food truck in Boston should be part of Boston's Booming Businesses and take advantage of the help found within this chamber.
