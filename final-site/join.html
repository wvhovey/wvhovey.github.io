            <h3 class="purpose-h3">Chamber Purpose and Goals</h3>
            <p class="purpose-p">
                This chamber began because the owners attempted to follow their dreams to start a food truck while they were in their early 20's.
                They had no support, and they failed many times until, by pure chance, they succeeded. It is the goal of this chamber to prevent that from happening to anyone who is attempting 
                to run a food truck in the greater Boston area. We offer financial assistance from the high taxes of Massachusetts, legal advice on how to begin
                the process of food trucking, regular luncheons, free advertisement on social media platforms with access to our advertisement department, and so much more.
                Every food truck in Boston should be part of Boston's Booming Businesses and take advantage of the help found within this chamber.
